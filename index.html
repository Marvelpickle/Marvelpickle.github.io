<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>I recently completed baccalaureate program in computer science at the University of Houston
during the school and internship as software intern in small blaster toy company, I have gained valuable experience not only 
 in front-end dev , database management and collaborative coding using Git. 
I also streamline the inventory system by developing an interface application that significantly improve inventory data auditing from oversea.
I am currently on the job market looking for full-time full stack engineer role.</p>
